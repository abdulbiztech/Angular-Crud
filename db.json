      "about": "I am particularly keen to understand the specific areas where my performance might not have fully met the expectations, as well as any suggestions for improvement. Constructive feedback would not only help me grow as a professional but also provide me with a clearer understanding of the company's expectations and how I can contribute effectively. My current position also offers a monthly salary of 30k, which has been my baseline for comparison. To fully commit to this new opportunity, I believe it's important for the compensation to be aligned with my experience, the industry standards, and the responsibilities associated with the Angular Developer role.",
